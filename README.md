# odin-recipes

This is the first "test" in the Odin Project where we will be making a Recipe Website.  

Self Reflection Beggining:
    It has been really good so far. Much further than anything on Youtube. Really has solidified alot of my knowledge of things in the BTC world as well.

Self Reflection Ending:
    It was super easy TBH.  I know that Odin Project holds our hand a bit and also VSCode kind of autofills things for us which is nice.  I assume that that is AI that uses it via CoPilot which I did not turn off.  But I am excited and gaining confidence in this whole process.  Well on my way.
